## Ipsum Belgum

Invented in Japan, Three Line Break charts ignore time and only change 
when prices move a certain amount. In this regard, these charts are quite 
similar to Point & Figure charts. Three Line Break charts show a series 
of vertical white and black lines. 

A reversal occurs when the closing price exceeds the high or low of the 
prior two lines.
